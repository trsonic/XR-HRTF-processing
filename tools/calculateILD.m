%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Function to calculate ILD of an HRIR. 
% Works by high pass filtering at cutoff 2200hz (down to 1.5k), 
% then calculate magnitude response difference between left and right for 
% 30 different ERB bands, and getting the absolute mean of all differences 
% between 1.5k and 20k. 
% 
% ILD value in dB
